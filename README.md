# Rate Issues

- Have you ever wonder how to contribute to an open-source project ?
- Did you ever feel like you should be a wizard to contribute with any project ?
- Did you questioned if solving an issue is too hard for you or not ?

RateIssues will solve those problems, build to help you to develop and contribute with open-source code

**This is a free project and it will always be, in the future we might have sponsors(maybe donators also) to support the production app**

## Main features
 * Find an open-source project to contribute
 * Give you more suitables issues to choose from and start working right away
 * Make the contributions more social and engaging


This project it was redone thinking about those new features above. To check the old project check the old version branch [here](https://github.com/cassioscabral/rateissuesfront/tree/old_rateissues)

## Reasons for the change in the app

This app that you see on the screenshot from the old interface focus on giving the user issues and nothing more than that. Maybe this would work but the user would only have two reasons to go back to the app, rate issues or search for issues, it feels like too much work to find anything interesting

The main reason for the change was to give the user the power to find a nice project that fits his expertise and from that choose issues more related with his areas of interest.
